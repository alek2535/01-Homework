# Accessibilty and Semantic Code Refactor
 The goal of this project was to make the webpage for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. meet accessibility and sementic standards. This meant cleaning up the code to have the right semantic element tags and that all images had alt text. Besides that I made sure it worked well with voice over and was able to be navigated by only using the keyboard.

 Along with having a semantic HTML file, the goal was to make sure the CSS file was clean and efficient. The original file had too many classes that each had their own CSS section with attributes that matched each other. I consolidated this by giving elements the same class if they each had the same styling. This made the CSS file smaller meaning the page will upload faster. 

 And last, but not least, I followed the Scout Rule and left the code cleaner than when I found it.
